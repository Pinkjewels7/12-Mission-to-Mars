In this assignment, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. The following outlines what I needed to do.

## Step 1 - Scraping

Completed the initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.

* Created a Jupyter Notebook file called `mission_to_mars.ipynb` and used this to complete all of my scraping and analysis tasks. The following outlines what I needed to scrape:

### NASA Mars News

### JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image

### Mars Weather

### Mars Facts

### Mars Hemispheres

- - -

## Step 2 - MongoDB and Flask Application

Used MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the websites listed above.
